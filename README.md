# The-Future-of-Retail-Fashion
This repo tackles my fourth year thesis project where I chose to investigate the future of fashion and where I think it's headed.

I chose to tackle the idea of how to enhance the experience of shopping through 3D projections on Mannequins (ideally), however since the project was limited by time, resources, and knowledge, I tested my hypothesis using 2D projections with only positive expectations if it were to be implemented in 3D

The main idea of the thesis was how to create a design that lays at the intersection of interactive retail (such as virtual mirrors or projections in campaign shoots), online shopping, and use of mannequins, and therefore the following design was conceived.

The user enters the store and stands in front of the mannequin (aspect of mannequin) after having selected the items online that they potentially might be interested seeing in store prior to coming (aspect of Online Shopping). The system recognizes the user whereby the user can swipe right or left to view the items in their wishlist (aspect of interactive retail). After confirming on which item of clothing they would like to see, the systemm proceeds to light the area in the store that contains that item for the convenience of the user.

## Technology Used
1. The logic of the system was written using a Python Script
2. The sensors and outputs were controlled by an Arduino Uno
3. Serial was used to communicate between the Python script and the Arduino
4. PILLOW and tkinter were used for image resizing and projections on the 2D screen.
5. A PAJ7620 gesture sensor was used for the input of the system and LED lights indicated the output of the system


## Demo of System
Here is a fun video to briefly showcase the thesis
