# The-Future-of-Retail-Fashion
This repo tackles my fourth year thesis project where I chose to investigate the future of fashion and where I think it's headed.

I chose to tackle the idea of how to enhance the experience of shopping through 3D projections on Mannequins (ideally), however since the project was limited by time, resources, and knowledge, I tested my hypothesis using 2D projections with only positive expectations if it were to be implemented in 3D

The main idea of the thesis was how to create a design that lays at the intersection of interactive retail (such as virtual mirrors or projections in campaign shoots), online shopping, and use of mannequins, and therefore the following design was conceived.
